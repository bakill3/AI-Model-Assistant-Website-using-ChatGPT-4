# **Project Title: User-Centric Chatbot Platform**

This repository houses a unique project that harnesses the power of **HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including jQuery & AJAX), PHP, Bootstrap 4**, and **OpenAI's ChatGPT-4**. The project aims to provide a robust user authentication system allowing users to create accounts, log in, and interact with diverse AI chatbot models in real time.

## **Project Overview**

After the initial login or registration, users are directed to a page where they can choose from four distinct chatbot models:

1. **Psychologist**: This model is designed to assist users in managing mental health-related issues, providing a platform for expressing concerns and receiving supportive feedback.

2. **Jarvis**: Styled after the iconic AI from the Marvel Universe, this model is all about current affairs and factual information. It's a go-to resource for users interested in up-to-date, accurate data.

3. **Programmer**: This model is a coder's best friend. It offers assistance in debugging and optimizing user's code, making the programming process smoother and more efficient.

4. **Buddy**: Designed to replicate a personal friend, this chatbot model is adept at casual conversation, acting as a digital companion to the user.

Upon selecting a model, users are redirected to a chat interface where they can send and receive real-time messages. All messages are processed through **OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 API**, allowing for intelligent and dynamic responses. All conversation data is stored in a database, preserving the chat history and providing continuity for future interactions.

## **Project Objectives**

The primary goal of this project is to create a model of ChatGPT that retains all previous user messages, effectively giving memory to the chatbot. This persistent memory is an exciting feature because it allows the bot to remember past interactions, thereby enabling more meaningful and contextually aware conversations over time.

Other benefits include:

- **Personalized User Experience**: By remembering past interactions, the AI can offer personalized responses, greatly enhancing user engagement.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: With a memory feature, the chatbot can provide responses that are aware of the historical context of the conversation.
- **Consistent User Experience**: The memory feature ensures that users can pick up where they left off in previous sessions, making for a seamless conversational experience.
